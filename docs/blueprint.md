## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Fox Red (#FF4500) for main actions and brand emphasis.
- Background color: Very dark grayish blue (#121317), for a modern, sleek look. This provides strong contrast for content areas while harmonizing with the black tone of the overall theme.
- Accent color: Light yellow (#FFE973) to complement Fox Red, used for highlights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headings to give a modern, techy look. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for the body, for readability and a neutral feel.
- Use simple, clear icons that represent various actions and statuses (e.g., completion, progress, alerts).
- Employ a clean, spacious layout that minimizes clutter and directs user attention effectively. Prioritize readability with ample whitespace and logical content grouping.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., progress bar updates, completion confetti) to provide feedback without distracting the user.
